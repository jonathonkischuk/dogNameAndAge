# dogNameAndAge
Taking a name and age of a dog as an input, it outputs the name with first letter only capitalized and the age in human years.
Using slice we separate the first letter from the rest of the name.
Then we make sure that first letter is capitalized and the remaining characters are all lowercase.
We concatenate them and store them in a variable as a properly capitalized name.
We then convert the dog years input to human years using the formula: humanAge = (dogAge - 2) * 4 +21
Then we store that in a variable.
Finally, we alert the user of the dogs name and age (in human years) in a fun way!
